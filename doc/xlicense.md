# xlicense


I think this analysis ....

> It started when Keith and Jim decided to pressure the XFree86 project on behalf of Linux distributions who felt that the XFree86 project wasn't acting in line with their business plans.

I can only collect pointers, so far:

 `Since we're looking at history, we can see that Jim is in the postion
 he is in because of his lack of vision and lack of confidence in
 the very technology that he helped create.  He abandoned X as a
 dead technology long ago.  He didn't have the vision to see where
 the burst of activity in the early 1990's that saw the emergence
 of Linux and other free operating systems would lead.  He failed
 to see that X as a technology could play a pivotal part in these
 developments.  This role was left to others, and was expressed
 through XFree86, predominantly by volunteers.  It wasn't until 1999
 when Linux was gaining significant credibility in the business world
 that Jim realised his mistake, and started publicly bullying the
 people who had done what he was incapable of, in an attempt to
 regain control of what he had abandoned as dead.`

 Most OpenSource projects are led by individuals who have been
 formally or informally been accepted as leaders for their long
 standing commitment, their experience and experise. If a formal
 governing body exists (in many cases because it is require by
 law) these boards perform purely administrational or political
 tasks.
 The gcc steering committee is an example here: It administrates
 the CVS and Web servers and - as this is a matter for the FSF



 watches over license issues. It consists of the original people
 who initiated egcs, new members are invited in.
 Where is the flaw in your proposal?
 How would a serious developer feel who has worked his butt off
 if anyone with little to no involvment in his project would be
 able to elect who is to preside over it - on a one-man one vote
 basis - with the same voting rights as him?
 How would this person feel if soemone happened to be elected
 to take over the leadership who has not written a single line
 of code for the project, but for example happens to be working
 for a "System integrator and distributors packaging X technology
 in various forms"?
 Do you expect any serious developer would continue to work on
 this project?
