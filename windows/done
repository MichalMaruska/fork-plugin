KdPrint is identical to the DbgPrint routine in code that is compiled for a debug
configuration. This routine has no effect if compiled for a release configuration. Only
kernel-mode drivers can call the KdPrint routine.


DebugPrint(("trying to set fork\n"));
vs.
KdPrint() ..... so this is #ifdef DBG
KdPrint(("%s we see E0/E1 flag %u\n", __func__, event->Flags));

#ifdef DBG
#define KdPrint(_x_) DbgPrint _x_
#else
#define KdPrint(_x_)
#endif

by rescan hardware I could restore it!
