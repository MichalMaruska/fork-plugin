* rename again

* publish:
- how to get it certified?
- how to build the ... cmake?


* build from cmdline on Github ?


* see keyboard.inf
to understand why needed:
STANDARD_Inst sections!


* difference
http://alter.org.ua/en/docs/nt_kernel/kdprint/
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kdprint

KdPrint is identical to the DbgPrint routine in code that is compiled for a debug
configuration. This routine has no effect if compiled for a release configuration. Only
kernel-mode drivers can call the KdPrint routine.


DebugPrint(("trying to set fork\n"));
vs.
KdPrint() ..... so this is #ifdef DBG
KdPrint(("%s we see E0/E1 flag %u\n", __func__, event->Flags));

#ifdef DBG
#define KdPrint(_x_) DbgPrint _x_
#else
#define KdPrint(_x_)
#endif



* how to attach as class driver? (Registry)

* time stamps


*
> Universal Windows Driver. It uses only APIs and DDIs that are included in OneCoreUAP.
this is the lowest?
the 3 levels of conformity?

* is this the old tool?  pnptool is better?
devcon hwid =keyboard
devcon classes
devcon listclass keyboard
devcon driverfiles *
devcon driverfiles  "ACPI\VEN_PNP&DEV_0303"

devcon drivernodes sw*
devcon drivernodes acpi*

    resources =keyboard
    stack =keyboard
    classfilter keyboard upper
    reboot
    rescan
    .... failed


* fixme: as administrator: !!!!
devcon install *.inf  "ACPI\VEN_PNP&DEV_0303"

"*DEV_0303"

Device node created. Install is complete when drivers are installed...
Updating drivers from
devcon.exe failed.

* ok I found the modification to be done to the .inx file!!!
Then this works:

devcon install *.inf  "ACPI\VEN_PNP&DEV_0303"
and requires reboot.

# devcon dp_add kbdfiltr.inf
oem7.inf added

pnputil /add-driver kbfiltr.inf
published Name: oem7.inf

log:
* c:\windows\inf\setupapi.dev.log


dvi: No CoInstallers found


mmc:
File> add/remove snap-in > Certificates > add

* I tried to update the keyboard driver.
I also edited the registry to have the top
"kbfilter kbdclass"
and I lost ....

" kbdclass" this value also didn't work!
"kbdclass" and reboot & voila'

once again:


"kbdclass,kbfiltr" ?




* so:
1. "kbdclass"
2. removing & rescan
"Standard PS/2 Keyboard"

no need to reboot!
