* fixme: as administrator: !!!!
devcon install *.inf  "ACPI\VEN_PNP&DEV_0303"

"*DEV_0303"

Device node created. Install is complete when drivers are installed...
Updating drivers from
devcon.exe failed.

* ok I found the modification to be done to the .inx file!!!
Then this works:
devcon install *.inf  "ACPI\VEN_PNP&DEV_0303"
and requires reboot.

# devcon dp_add kbdfiltr.inf
oem7.inf added

pnputil /add-driver kbfiltr.inf

* debugview as admin !!!

by rescan hardware I could restore it!



* I tried to update the keyboard driver.
I also edited the registry to have the top
"kbfilter kbdclass"
and I lost ....

" kbdclass" this value also didn't work!
"kbdclass" and reboot & voila'

once again:


"kbdclass,kbfiltr" ?




* so:
1. "kbdclass"
2. removing & rescan
"Standard PS/2 Keyboard"

no need to reboot!



* BSOD & reboot loop:
RE recovery:

dism /image:c:\ /get-drivers
dism /image:c:\ /remove-driver /driver:oem#.inf


* allocate machine, queues, env

- once I get event in a buffer .... what to do, copy over to.

ExAllocatePoolWithTag()


|--queue----|--- queue--|----qH----|
                              ^ put it here?

exit --> buffer.
