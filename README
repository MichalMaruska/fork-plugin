* What it is
This is a plugin for an alternative (pipeline) architecture of
key-event processing in Xorg server.

The patch for this is currently available as a debian package.
   https://launchpad.net/~mmaruska/+archive/mmc-pipeline
(This plugin is available there too, but this git repo is updated).

There is some explanation of what this plugin does at:
http://www.ruska.it/michal/fork.html




* Implementation:

We are called through these calls:

- ProcessEvent
- mouse_call_back
- step_in_time  (...We provide the time at which we want to be woken)


We look at the Parallelism of key strokes (also mouse movement parallelism)
and can change some Events (the keycode).



There is also synchronization with device Freeze/Thaw.
- fork_thaw_notify


* Configuration parameters:

** Matrix verification_interval:
       verificator   0
     +--------------------
code |  time       per-se


This much after. code.


** overlap_tolerance



* bit map
Forkable.
