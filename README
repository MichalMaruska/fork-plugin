* Implementation:

Plugins on the pipeline have following api:

- ProcessEvent
- mouse_call_back
- step_in_time  (...We provide the time at which we want to be woken)


* Specificly "forking" plugin
We look at the Parallelism of key strokes (also mouse movement parallelism)
and can change some Events (the keycode).


There is also synchronization with device Freeze/Thaw.
- fork_thaw_notify

* Configuration parameters:

** Matrix verification_interval:
       verificator   0
     +--------------------
code |  time       per-se


This much after. code.


** overlap_tolerance



* bit map
Forkable.
